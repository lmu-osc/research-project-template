# Analysis Scripts

This directory contains all scripts related to data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Consider organizing scripts with numbered prefixes to indicate order of execution (e.g., `01_data_cleaning.R`, `02_exploratory_analysis.py`, `03_modeling.R`).

Helper functions or utility scripts can be placed in a `utils/` subdirectory or named appropriately (e.g., `utils.R`).
